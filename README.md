#How To Run ?

The code consists of three functions with one object, the first function is the Countdown function which is responsible for the time countdown process, second one is the start function, this function is responsible for the Start process which starts the countdown, the final functions is called the stop function which is resposible for stopping the countdown.
***


#What ?

Well, the function which is resposible for the countdown takes minutes and seconds only which starts the countdown every second then counts down the minutes untill it reaches the 0 value of minutes.
***


#why?

Because of the testing step, because we want to make sure that the object we used should return the function correctly, and also to make sure that the function returns done whenever it's done to makes sure that it operates well.
***


#how?

By making a comparison between the source code and the testind code, the source code should operate as the test code, both of the codes should be compatible with the other, of course this should lead into a clear goad which is creating the best performance for the code and to prevent errors from being applied.
***


#project plan?
First, we created the project with three files, the first is the index file which contains the HTML and CSS codes, the second file is the Java Script code file, this is the basic file which contains the real-time functions operates in the background of the page and it's the most importanat file, finally we created the test file which makes the test of the Java Script code and test's if the code works perfectly as it should be or not, which is very important manner.
